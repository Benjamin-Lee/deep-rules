## Conclusion {#conclusion}

Deep learning techniques have the potential for wide use in biology, meeting or exceeding the performance of both humans and the current state-of-the art algorithms in an variety of tasks while generating biological insights that may be applied back to fundamental research. 
To realize this potential, the use of deep learning as a research tool must be approached as any other tool would be: thoughtfully, systematically, and [**TODO**: fill in an adverb here. Ideas: deliberately, ethically, carefully, reproducibly].
We hope that the tips we present will serve as a starting point for the discussion of best practices for deep learning as they apply to biology, not as an ending point.
As the field of deep learning matures, with its theoretical underpinnings more fully understood, the best practices for its use will surely evolve as well.
