## Conclusion {#conclusion}

Deep learning techniques have the potential for wide use in biology, meeting or exceeding the performance of both humans and the current state-of-the art algorithms in a variety of tasks.
Beyond simply achieving good predictive performance, deep learning has the potential to generate novel biological insights that may then be applied back to fundamental research.
To realize this potential, the use of deep learning as a research tool must be approached as any other tool would be: scientifically and thoughtfully.
We hope that our tips will serve as a starting point for the discussion of best practices for deep learning as they apply to biology, not as an ending point.
