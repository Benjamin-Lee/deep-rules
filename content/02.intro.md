## Introduction

Deep learning (DL), a subfield of machine learning (ML) implementing hierarchical artificial neural networks, is increasingly used for the analysis of biological data [@doi:10.1098/rsif.2017.0387].
Despite its growing popularity, DL itself remains an active area of research. Its everchanging complexity and lack of current beginner resources focused on biological applications pose large barriers of entry to newcomers who wish to utilize state-of-the-art DL in their research.
Biological insight garnered from DL has been well-documented in the scientific literature, with applications ranging from predicting protein-drug binding kinetics [@doi:10.1038/s41467-017-02388-1] to identifying the lab-of-origin of synthetic DNA [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-05378-z]. However, few resources articulate DL best practices to the scientific community. Most instructional literature focuses on ML broadly, rather than DL specifically, further limiting accessibility and reproducibility [@doi:10.1186/s13040-017-0155-3].

To address this issue, we solicited input from a diverse community of researchers, who wrote this manuscript collaboratively using the GitHub version control platform [@url:https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-review] and Manubot [@url:https://greenelab.github.io/meta-review/].
In the course of our discussions, several themes became clear: the importance of understanding and applying ML fundamentals as a baseline for utilizing DL, the necessity for extensive model comparisons and careful evaluation, and the need for critical thought in interpreting results generated by means of DL, among others.
Ultmately, the rules we established range from high-level guidance to the implementation of best practices, and it is our hope that they will provide actionable, DL-specific advice for both new and experienced DL practitioners alike who would like to employ DL in biological research.
By increasing the accessibility of DL techniques to biology, we aim to improve the overall quality and reproducibility of DL in the literature, enabling these powerful methods to be properly utilized to generate new scientific insights.
