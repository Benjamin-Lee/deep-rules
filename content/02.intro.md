## Introduction {#intro}

Deep learning (DL), a subfield of machine learning (ML) implementing artificial neural networks with many layers, is increasingly used for the analysis of biological data [@doi:10.1098/rsif.2017.0387].
In many cases, novel biological insights have been revealed through careful evaluation of DL methods ranging from predicting protein-drug binding kinetics [@doi:10.1038/s41467-017-02388-1] to identifying the lab-of-origin of synthetic DNA [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-05378-z].
However, a lack of relevant up-to-date resources focused on biological applications of DL pose a significant barrier to newcomers wishing to utilize state-of-the-art DL in their research.
As DL is an active and specialized research area, detailed resources are rapidly rendered obsolete and few resources articulate general DL best practices to the scientific community.
Most instructional literature focuses on ML broadly, rather than DL specifically, further limiting accessibility and reproducibility.
To address this issue, we solicited input from a diverse community of researchers, who wrote this manuscript collaboratively using the GitHub version control platform [@url:https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules] and Manubot [@url:https://greenelab.github.io/meta-review/].

In the course of our discussions, several themes became clear: the importance of understanding and applying ML fundamentals  [@doi:10.1186/s13040-017-0155-3] as a baseline for utilizing DL, the necessity for extensive model comparisons with careful evaluation, and the need for critical thought in interpreting results generated by means of DL, among others.
Ultimately, the tips we collate range from high-level guidance to the implementation of best practices, and it is our hope that they will provide actionable, DL-specific advice for both new and experienced DL practitioners alike who would like to employ DL in biological research.
By increasing the accessibility of DL techniques to biology, we aim to improve the overall quality and reproducibility of DL in the literature, enabling these powerful methods to be properly utilized to generate new scientific insights.
