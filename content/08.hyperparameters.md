## Tip 6: Tune your hyperparameters extensively and systematically {#hyperparameters}

Given at least one hidden layer, a non-linear activation function, and a large number of hidden units, multi-layer neural networks can approximate arbitrary continuous functions that relate input and output variables [@doi:10/dzwxkd; @doi:10/bjjdg2].
Deeper architectures that feature additional hidden layers and an increasing number of overall hidden units and learnable weight parameters (the so-called increasing "capacity" of neural networks) allow for solving increasingly complex problems.
However, this increased capacity results in many more parameters to fit and hyperparameters to tune, which can pose additional challenges during model training.
In general, one should expect to systematically evaluate the impact of numerous hyperparameters when applying deep neural networks to new data or challenges.
Hyperparameters typically manifest as choices of optimization algorithms, loss function, learning rate, activation functions, number of hidden layers and hidden units, size of the training batches, and weight initialization schemes.
Moreover, additional hyperparameters are introduced by common techniques that facilitate training deeper architectures.
These include regularization penalties, dropout [@tag:srivastava-dropout], and batch normalization [@tag:ioffe-batchnorm], which can reduce the effect of the so-called vanishing or exploding gradient problem when working with deep neural networks.

This wide array of potential parameters can make it difficult to evaluate the extent to which neural network methods are well suited to solving a task.
For example, it can be unclear to practitioners whether previously successful deep learning applications were the result of general model suitability for the data at hand or interactions between unique data attributes and specific hyperparameter settings.
As a result, a lack of clarity about how extensive arrays of hyperparameters were tested or chosen can hamper method developers as they attempt to compare techniques.
This effect also has implications for those seeking to use existing deep learning methods, as performance estimates from deep neural networks are often provided after tuning.
The implication is that attaining performance numbers that match those reported in publications is likely to require significant effort towards temporally expensive hyperparameter optimization.
Strategies for tuning hyperparameters include exhaustive grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization and other specialized techniques.
Tools such as Keras Tuner (https://keras-team.github.io/keras-tuner/) and Ray Tune (https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html) support best practices for hyperparameter optimization.

To get the best performance from your model, researchers should be sure to systematically optimize their hyperparameters on the training dataset and report both the selected hyperparameters and the hyperparameter optimization strategy.
