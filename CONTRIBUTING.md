# Contribution guidelines for Deep Rules

Please see [`USAGE.md`](USAGE.md) for information on how to use the Manubot for writing the manuscript.
Below you'll find information on the contribution workflow for Deep Rules.

## Issues

We use issues for discussion of papers, section outlines, and other structural components of the paper.

## Pull requests

Contributions to the article operate on a pull request model. We expect participants to actively review pull requests.
We'd love to have you ask questions, clarify points, and jump in and edit the text.

To mark a pull request as a work in progress, use `WIP`, `work in progress`, or `ðŸš§` somewhere in the title to automatically prevent merging.

## Authorship

What qualifies as authorship? We use the [ICMJE Guidelines](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html).
We expect authors to contribute to the overall design by participating in issues, to contribute to the text by contributing sections and/or revisions to sections through pull requests.
It is important to note that, for authorship, these should be substantial intellectual contributions.

## Peer review

All pull requests will undergo peer review.
Participants in this project should review proposed changes (pull requests), which can be done using [GitHub's review interface](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/).
They should suggest modifications or, potentially, directly edit the pull request to make suggested changes.
As a reviewer, it's helpful to note the type of review you performed: did you read cited literature, look over the text in detail, or are you just supporting the concept?

Before a repository maintainer merges a pull request, there must be at least one affirmative review by someone other than the author and the maintainer.
If there is any unaddressed criticism or disapproval, a repository maintainer will determine how to proceed and may wait for additional feedback.

## The Contribution Process

1. Contributor creates a new pull request (optionally with `[WIP]` in the title to indicate work in progress)
2. Pull request author removes [`WIP`] to indicate it is ready for review
3. Maintainer suggests edits and approves the pull request after all changes are made
4. Second maintainer approves and merges the pull request
5. If you have met the requirements for all of the columns in [`contributors.md`](contributors.md) (except for final approval), PR your information to [`content/metadata.yaml`](content/metadata.yaml). **Note: authorship order in `content/metadata.yaml` reflects chronological order, not final authorship order.** Final authorship order will be determined when we are finished with our draft and it is ready for submission.
